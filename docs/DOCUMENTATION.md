## My Target Audience-

-includes **Career Coaches, Mentors, Teachers, Hiring Managers, Recruiters, My Peers, Karaoke Singers, Karaoke DJs, Bar Attendees, Bar Employees,** and **Night Owls** in general.

## I want to create a web application that-

-alleviates the _pressure_ of **indecision** while providing a _fun_ user experience and _organization_ tool for those who either work in or hang out in Bars, complete with personal _karaoke song lists_, favorite _drink recipes_, favorite _bars to attend_, and more.

## The story behind this idea-

-is a simple one. I have worked in and frequented quite a few bars in my life, mostly as a karaoke singer and DJ, and the one thing that _always_ seems to rear its ugly head in the industry is **indecision**. Whether it's a regular karaoke singer trying to decide _which_ one of their go-to songs to belt out, or a group of friends attempting to settle on _which_ shot they should all try together in honour of someone's birthday, or a married couple that finally has a babysitter for the night and wants to choose _which_ bar they should even go to, the one thing they _all_ share is **indecision**.

So I thought to myself, "Hey, wouldn't it be _great_ if there was a _button_ we could press that would _choose_ one of these things for us in an _organized_ and _user-friendly_ way?", and the idea for **Owull** was born. Users would have the ability to create their own _lists of favorites_ in various bar-related categories, and, with the press of a button, **Owull** would choose one of those list items in the particular category at _random_ for them. It would turn the whole experience of **indecision** into a game of chance with _no risk_ of unwanted options.

 **Owull** could _eventually_ be updated to include various lists of all sorts of activities completely unrelated to bars and make **indecision** a much more fun experience. Such as, for instance, what movie to go see in theaters, or what should the family have for dinner on a particular night. For now, however, **Owull** will stick to what it knows. The night-life.
