## My Target Audience-

-includes **Career Coaches, Mentors, Teachers, Hiring Managers, Recruiters, My Peers, Karaoke Singers, Karaoke DJs, Bar Attendees, Bar Employees,** and **Night Owls** in general.

## I want to create a web application that-

-gives users the ability to **login** and **save a list** of all karaoke songs they usually sing by *Original Artist* and *Song Title*. I also want them to be able to **press a button** to have one of those songs chosen **at random** for them. Or if they are feeling *brave* they could press a *separate button* that would choose a song from **every users list combined**.

## The story behind this idea-

-is a simple one, really. I've worked as a karaoke DJ for well over 6 years and I have been singing karaoke since 2002. One of the *hardest* things to deal with in the business is **indecision**. At least **one singer, each night I'm running karaoke,** will ask me the question, **"What should I sing?"**, knowing *full well* that I have no clue what they are *capable* of singing or what they're even in the *mood* to sing. **Owull** would not only *solve* that dilemma by giving singers a way to *answer* that question for *themselves* (which would speed up the flow of the rest of the night), it would also add an extra element of *fun* in the form of **"Karaoke Roulette"**.

-- Eventually, I want to add **categories**, **lyrics** and other features to the application related to *Bar Activities* such as *Pool and Dart Leagues* and *Drink Recipes*, as well as information regarding *what* activities certain bars offer and at what *time*, etc., but those ambitions can wait for now.
